War Game Turing College task

## Classes:
- **`Card`** – Represents a card with a rank and suit.
- **`Player`** – Represents a player with a deck of cards.

## Functions for Game Logic:
- **`play_round(player1, player2)`** – Plays a round and returns updated data.
- **`war(player1, player2)`** – Handles a "war" scenario.
- **`play_game(player1, player2)`** – Runs the entire game using a `while` loop.

This way, classes only store data, while all game logic is managed through functions.
