# War Card Game

## Project Overview
Implement the children's card game **War** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. You can define game mechanics and outputs, and even implement variations. The project involves **Git** and **remote pair programming**.

## Setup
1. Create a **public GitHub repository** with a `README.md` file.
2. Clone the repository locally.
3. Define game requirements in `README.md`, then commit and push.

## Pair Programming Process
1. **Find a partner** (via Discord, stand-ups, or open sessions).
2. Arrange at least **3 sessions**:
   - **1 session** working on your project.
   - **1 session** working on someone else's project.
3. Create **GitHub issues** for planned tasks before each session.
4. **During the session**:
   - Decide who codes first (use `random` module if needed).
   - The coder assigns an issue, shares their screen, and writes code.
   - After half the time, commit & push changes.
   - Switch roles and repeat.

## Bonus Challenge
- Deliberately create a **merge conflict** and resolve it.

## Completing the Project
- Continue working solo between sessions.
- Ensure at least **3 pair programming sessions** are completed.
- Finish remaining tasks and finalize the project.
