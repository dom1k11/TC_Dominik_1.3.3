## Pair Programming Process
1. **Find a partner** (via Discord, stand-ups, or open sessions).
2. Arrange at least **3 sessions**:
   - **1 session** working on your project.
   - **1 session** working on someone else's project.
3. Create **GitHub issues** for planned tasks before each session.
4. **During the session**:
   - Decide who codes first (use `random` module if needed).
   - The coder assigns an issue, shares their screen, and writes code.
   - After half the time, commit & push changes.
   - Switch roles and repeat.

## Bonus Challenge
- Deliberately create a **merge conflict** and resolve it.

## Completing the Project
- Continue working solo between sessions.
- Ensure at least **3 pair programming sessions** are completed.
- Finish remaining tasks and finalize the project.



## Classes:
- **`Card`** – Represents a card with a rank and suit.
- **`Player`** – Represents a player with a deck of cards.

## Functions for Game Logic:
- **`play_round(player1, player2)`** – Plays a round and returns updated data.
- **`war_scenario(player1, player2)`** – Handles a "war" scenario.
- **`start(player1, player2)`** – Runs the entire game using a `while` loop.

This way, classes only store data, while all game logic is managed through functions.
